## API Used
No external API is currently integrated. The code includes a placeholder for future API integration (e.g., `https://api.djAdolph.com`).

## Project Description
This is a modern, responsive, single-page website for DJ Adolph, featuring:
- A visually engaging hero section
- Detailed services overview
- An interactive online booking form with real-time validation
- A performance analytics dashboard with animated counters
- Social media links and contact information
- Custom UI/UX enhancements, including a music visualizer, floating elements, and dynamic background particles

## Custom Requirement Explanation
The project includes a custom booking form that:
- Validates user input in real-time (including email and phone number formats)
- Prevents selection of past dates
- Animates a confirmation modal upon successful booking
- Updates analytics counters dynamically based on new bookings
- Is designed for future integration with a backend API for booking management

All UI/UX features are implemented using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within a single file, with a focus on modern design and smooth user experience.
